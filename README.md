# Peek

A tiny lightweight image viewer.

I created this program due to the annoying default image viewer in Windows 8, and the old Image Preview thingy being odd under W8.

All this app does is display the image added as argument to the .exe file in a fullscreen window. Left and Right will navigate in the same folder. Ctrl+W/Q/Escape will quit the app, and Delete will move the current file to the Recycle Bin.

Happy viewing...
