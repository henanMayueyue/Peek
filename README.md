# Peek

A tiny lightweight image viewer.

I created this program due to the annoying default image viewer in Windows 8, and the old Image Preview thingy being odd under W8.

All this app does is display the image added as argument to the .exe file in a fullscreen window.

Possible key-combos are:

* Left/Right - Navigate the folder where the loaded image is located.
* Delete - Send the file to the Recycle Bin.
* Shift+Delete - Deletes the file from disk.
* Ctrl+W/Q/Escape - Quits the application.
* Alt+Enter/F - Toggles fullscreen/windowed viewing.
* 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 - Selects the screen with that index.
* 0 - Select the screen where the mouse pointer is. (default)

Happy viewing...
